              i've beeen looking to make a transition and have heard some
              people who had an amazing experince here. 
              I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
              enrolled shortly thereafter.
               The next 12 weeks was the best- and most grueling-time of my life
              Since completing the course, 
              I've successfully switched careers,

            <p class="kcomment">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code 
              I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
              programming step by step. I was encouraged tp enroll by a former 
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
              The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on 
              and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in 
              paarticular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way 
              that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I'vee often referred to it during
              interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me 
              land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offerrs. 100% recommend!"
